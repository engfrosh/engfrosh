# AWS SES

## Notes
### AWS Account Limitations
- By default, an AWS may be in the "Amazon SES sandbox." This limits to whom you can send an email (verified emails only).
- More info about this, as well as how to move out of the sandbox can be found 
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html)

### Credentials Note 
- In order to use boto3 (AWS's python library) locally, you must add a credentials file for authentication.
- Instructions on how to create this file can be found
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/create-shared-credentials-file.html)
  - This file MAY be able to be moved, depending on the situation, however I have not looked into it as it seems 
    unnecessary. However, [this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
    may help should you wish to do so:
- As always with these types of files, make sure you do not add it to your GIT/VCS, or you may have a bad time when 
  someone starts using your account without permission.
  
## Usage
A function was created for this project to make it simpler to send emails using SES.

To use this function, first import the file AWS_SES.py in the engfrosh_common module. 
Then call the function send_SES(sender_email, recipient_email, subject, body_text, body_html):.
#### Arguments: 
- sender_email: The "From" address. This address must be verified with Amazon SES.  
- recipient_email: The "To" address. If your account is still in the sandbox, this address must be verified.
- subject: The subject line for the email.
- body_text: The email body for recipients with non-HTML email clients.
- body_html: The HTML body of the email. Change the body as you like
