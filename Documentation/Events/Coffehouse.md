# Coffeehouse

### Platform & Event Description
- Participants will sign up to perform either using the website / discord bot / google form
- They will be sent an OBSNinja link to the presentation room just before their time to 
present so they can join the room.
- Once they are up and ready, the stream controller will put them on the livestream. 
- The controller will immediately take them off stream if they are not following proper 
EngFrosh _protocols_. 

### Further Work
- Test if someone can be kicked out of an OBSNinja Room.
