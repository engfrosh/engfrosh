# Contributing

### Branches
Work off of the relevant development branch and commit to that.

You are encouraged to create your own branches, please name them as `[your name]/[branch name]`.

## Python Style

Try and keep line length to a maximum of 90 characters and don't go over 120. I recommend 
adding rulers at these distances and setting your formatter (I recommend autopep8) to
wrap lines longer than 120.

### Linting
When working in python, run linting on your code before you commit (or at least before you 
want to pull it into the development branch).

## Getting Started

If you are working with Django you will need to get that installed.

If you are working with Python you will need a version installed (3.9) and then use the
virtual environment to install the packages.
